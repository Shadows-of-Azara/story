Before measure, before sound, before the counting of stars, there was silence.

The galaxy was wide, and the planets were many, scattered across the dark like distant thoughts. Among the Titans, ancient beings of creation and ruin, there was one whose name was never written. He was the celestial leader of existence, the first will, the shaping hand.

And his gaze rested upon a small world.

It was dry and broken, its surface cracked and bare, yet its winds were gentle and its light was beautiful. The Titan looked upon this planet for a long while, and favor grew within him. Of all the worlds, this one he liked a lot.

He raised his hands over the planet.

At his motion, the dry land split open. The cracks widened, and from the deep places water rose and spread. Seas filled the empty hollows, and the world learned movement and calm. The Titan watched, and he was satisfied.

From his palm fell magic dust, ancient and bright. When it touched the surface, it became sand. Slowly, carefully, he spread it across the waters. Small islands rose first, fragile and scattered. With time, the islands grew and pressed outward until they became continents, vast and firm beneath the sky.

The shapes of the lands were already decided, though the work was not complete.

The Titan pinched the earth between his fingers and lifted it upward. Stone folded upon stone, and mountains rose, tall and unmoving. With the trace of his fingers, he carved rivers into the land. They flowed naturally, following paths chosen long before they were formed. Time passed, and the shaping continued.

When the world was finished, the Titan spoke its name.

Azara.
The land was complete, but it was empty, and emptiness displeased him a lot.
So the Titan turned his attention to creation once more.

From the rich soil of Azara, he gathered earth, warm and full of life. He shaped it into a form that could stand and walk. He gave it hands to build and eyes to wonder. Then he breathed into it a spark of will.

Thus, humans were born.

They were not made eternal. Their lives were short, and their bodies fragile, but their spirits burned bright. The Titan gave them curiosity, desire, and the need to seek meaning. He gave them fear so they would survive, and hope so they would endure. He knew they would struggle a lot, but struggle would make them grow.

Yet as the Titan observed them, he saw that humans would wander far across the world. They would change the land, but they would not know its deepest bones.

So he shaped another people.

From the heart of the mountains, he carved bodies of stone and iron. He made them short and broad, with arms like pillars and backs that could bear the weight of the world. He hardened their skin and filled their blood with fire and ore.

Thus, the dwarves were born.

To them, the Titan gave the deep places of Azara. He taught them the language of stone and the patience of the earth. They learned to mine the mountains, to shape metal, and to build halls beneath the world. Their beards grew long as symbols of age and honor. They were stubborn and unyielding, loyal to kin and craft. Where humans built upward, dwarves built inward, carving their legacy into the bones of the land.

Still, the world was not balanced, and the Titan desired harmony a lot.
So he turned to the forests.

From living wood and flowing sap, he shaped slender forms. He gave them long limbs and sharp senses. He bound their spirits to the rhythm of wind and leaf, and their hearts to the passing of seasons.

Thus, the wood elves were born.

They moved lightly upon the earth, leaving no wound behind. The forests recognized them as kin. The trees bent to shelter them, and the beasts did not fear their presence. The Titan gave them long life, keen sight, and quiet wisdom. They became watchers of the wild places, guardians of growth and decay.

And so Azara was filled.

Humans walked the open lands and dreamed of endless futures.
Dwarves claimed the mountains and shaped the world with hammer and flame.
Wood elves dwelled among the forests, keeping the ancient balance.

And the Titan looked upon his creations.

And the world breathed.
