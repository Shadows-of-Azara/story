The demons spread their wings wide and tore through the sky toward the mountains of Stonehelm, the ancient home of the dwarves.

Iron ran in dwarven blood, and weapons were their closest companions. Fear stirred in their hearts—but it did not weaken them. It fed their excitement.

From the gates of the mountain capital emerged a lone figure clad in steel, his armor thick and scarred by countless battles. In his hands rested a massive warhammer, heavy and unyielding, forged to shatter bone and stone alike.

It was him—King Thoradin Anvilheart.

Rumors claimed he had saved over a hundred children and defeated thousands without suffering a single scar. Whether truth or legend, none dared question his strength.

Thoradin stepped before his people and faced the closed gates. His voice rang out, calm and steady, echoing through stone and soul alike.

“Children of Stonehelm… shadows gather beyond our gates. We face the unknown. But we were shaped by stone, not broken by fear. Stand with me, and let the mountain remember our strength!”

Simple words—yet they ignited a fire.

Weapons were raised: guns, hammers, swords, bows, axes. With a thunderous war cry, the gates of Stonehelm opened, and the dwarves marched out to meet their enemy.

Across the snowy field, the demons descended. As they touched the ground, darkness spilled outward, swallowing the white earth. From the frozen soil, shadowy creatures clawed their way free—twisted, mindless monsters rushing forward without hesitation.

Thoradin raised his hammer.

The command was given.

Gunfire thundered. Arrows screamed through the air. Steel met shadow as the first wave shattered—only to reform moments later.

A dwarf tightened his grip on his axe and growled, “Necromancers.”

The realization spread quickly, and with it, a grim truth. Necromancers were dark mages who commanded ancient magic, raising the dead again and again. Their creations could not truly die unless the summoner was slain.

The King reacted instantly.

“Spread east and north,” Thoradin ordered. “Search beneath trees and stone. When you find these bastards—kill them.”

Elite warriors broke from the formation, racing into the chaos. But separation made them vulnerable.

That was when the demi-god entered the battlefield.

He carried no weapon—he did not need one. With terrifying speed, he lunged toward a lone dwarf, claws slashing for his neck. The dwarf blocked with his hammer and struck back, cracking the demon’s leg.

Pain flickered—but the creature did not fall.

“Monster!” the dwarf shouted.

The demon struck again, but a gunshot rang out. A bullet tore through his claw, forcing his arm aside long enough for the dwarf to escape. Arrows followed, steel-tipped shafts piercing wing and flesh.

Only then did the demi-god understand.

Dwarves might be small, but together, their strength rivaled demons.

The creature straightened and spoke in the dwarven tongue, his voice echoing across the battlefield.

“You have time to surrender and give me the fragment…”

His eyes locked onto Thoradin.

“Or you will watch your people die, one by one.”

Blood flowed from his wounds, drawn toward his open palm. It twisted and hardened, forming a spear of living crimson.

Thoradin calmly lifted a necklace from his chest. At its center hung a small box. He opened it, revealing the shard within.

“If you want it,” the King said, “then come and take it.”

He signaled the shooters to retreat. They obeyed without hesitation.

Thoradin removed his crown and cast it aside. He raised his warhammer.

“I am Thoradin Anvilheart.”

The demon answered, accepting the challenge. “Razork.”

Steel met blood. Thoradin’s hammer shattered the spear and crushed Razork’s arm. The demon leapt back, blood flowing and reforming his limb.

“Blood magic,” Thoradin muttered. “Cheap tricks.”

Razork struck back, using his wings to seize the King and lift him skyward, tearing the hammer from his grip. A fall from such height would crush any dwarf.

But Thoradin only chuckled.

“Surprise.”

He drew a hidden gun and fired point-blank into Razork’s face. Both crashed into the deep snow below. The impact broke a single bone—but the King rose.

Around them, the battle was turning. Shadow creatures faded. Necromancers fell.

Thoradin knelt beside a fallen dwarf, kissed his forehead in honor, and took the warrior’s axe.

“Razork,” he growled, “you gave me a decent fight.”

Knowing the demon would regenerate, Thoradin chose what could not be restored.

He severed one of Razork’s wings.

The demon screamed—not from pain, but from loss.

Thoradin raised the wing high and roared, “KILL EVERYTHING THAT DOES NOT BELONG IN OUR HOME!”

The dwarves answered with fury.

Then a branch snapped.

Thoradin turned just as shadows swallowed Razork and a necromancer dragged him away. They vanished.

The battlefield fell silent.

Stonehelm had won—but at a cost.

Thoradin touched his neck.

The medallion was gone.

The shard had been stolen.

The first war was over.
